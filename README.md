Ugh, just finished watching Riff Raff, and let me tell you, it's got all the mad energy, you know what I mean? Half the time I couldn't even keep up with what was going on, but in a weird way, I kinda loved it. Like, seriously, how do they even make characters so chaotic and real? It's like you're just a fly on a dodgy wall. 

So there's this bit where everyone's just yelling over each other, and I'm sitting there thinking, would my brain explode from all the noise? They all have their little dramas and whatnot, but isn't life just a whole lotta random noise sometimes? Anyway, it had me thinking about life and stuff, but maybe that’s ‘cause I’m sleepy.

> Although, why is it the only time I ever truly watch the movie without zoning out is when it’s showing life's garbage side? LOL. And the accents! Man, I could barely understand half of ‘em, but I wouldn’t dream of throwing on subtitles. Adds to the charm, sorta like watching a train about to derail but you can’t look away. Oh, and note to self: I should download the movie for when I need a dose of gritty reality.

Didn’t you say we all have a little bit of Riff Raff in us—like, metaphorically? I get what you meant now! Ha, just one crazy world we’re trying to make sense of, right? And these characters, man, they make poor decisions but don’t we all sometimes, just mess up left and right. What’s that saying, life imitates art, or the other way around?

So, in the end, I’m just sitting here, and I can barely remember half the plot but it’s more a vibe anyway. Maybe watching such stuff is perfect for when I’m feeling out of sorts. Or maybe I should stop analyzing and just roll with it. I dunno, seriously! Remind me to tell you to watch it when you’re in the mood for something raw and a bit messy.

int main() { return 0; }

Anyway, I should crash soon or I’ll be a zombie tomorrow. Thanks for sticking around with my ramblings. Catch ya later!
